"""Property key name mapping via wiki cross-reference and distribution analysis.

Cross-references wiki item data with decoded gamelogic entries to discover
what binary property keys (0x10XXXXXX) mean in human terms.

Entry format:
  0x79XXXXXX entries in client_gamelogic.dat use a "dup-triple" encoding:
  [preamble:2B] [key:u32][val:u32] [key:u32][key:u32][val:u32] ...
  These share a 24-bit namespace with 0x25XXXXXX localization strings.

Discovery methods:
  1. Wiki correlation: match entries to wiki items via the string table,
     then find property keys whose values match known wiki fields.
  2. Distribution analysis: classify keys by their value distributions
     across all entries (see DISCOVERED_KEYS constant).

Key finding: minimum_level is stored directly as key 0x10001C5D in
dup-triple items (confirmed via Black Opal Bracers ML=31 cross-check).
