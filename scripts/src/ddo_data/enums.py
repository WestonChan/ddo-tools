"""Canonical enum constants for DDO build planner.

All string constants used in the DB schema, parser mappings, and frontend
queries are defined here. Using enum members instead of raw strings catches
typos at import/lint time.

Each enum extends ``str`` so values work directly in SQL queries, dict
lookups, and JSON serialization without conversion.

Usage::

    from ddo_data.stat_names import S, ItemCategory, BonusType

    # In aliases:
    _STAT_ALIASES = {"ac": S.ARMOR_CLASS, ...}

    # In writer:
    if item_category == ItemCategory.WEAPON: ...
